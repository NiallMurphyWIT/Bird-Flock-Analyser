# Bird-Flock-Analyser
A programme to analyse an image of a bird flock. Created by Niall Murphy 
This programme takes an input of an image(works best with a flock of birds in the sky with minimal background details) and outputs the same image but with each bird marked and counted.
Sample image that I used -> https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwitjuH6lorlAhXUVsAKHdqLCZAQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.innovativestencils.com%2Fflock-of-birds-wall-decal-1169%2F&psig=AOvVaw1eTfQ2w4FlrYiCdXBUvW0c&ust=1570538750084278
