# Bird-Flock-Analyser
A programme to analyse an image of a bird flock. 
This programme takes an input of an image(works best with a flock of birds in the sky with minimal background details) and outputs the same image but with each bird marked and counted.
Sample image that I used -> https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server1500/8eaf0/product_images/uploaded_images/flock-of-birds-wall-decal-sticker-1169.jpg.
